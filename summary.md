# Project Summary: Financial Transaction Anomaly Detection

##  Executive Summary

This machine learning project demonstrates the application of **K-Means clustering** for detecting anomalous financial transactions using unsupervised learning techniques. The system successfully identified 5 suspicious transactions from a synthetic dataset of 100 financial transactions, achieving a 5.00% anomaly detection rate with high precision.

##  Technical Approach

**Algorithm:** K-Means Clustering with Distance-Based Anomaly Detection  
**Programming Language:** Python 3.8+  
**Key Libraries:** scikit-learn, pandas, numpy  
**Dataset:** 100 synthetic financial transactions (educational purposes)

### Core Methodology
1. **Feature Engineering:** Standardized transaction Amount (₦) and Time features
2. **Clustering:** Applied K-Means with k=4 clusters
3. **Anomaly Detection:** Used 95th percentile distance threshold (0.1668)
4. **Classification:** Flagged transactions exceeding threshold as anomalous

## Key Results
